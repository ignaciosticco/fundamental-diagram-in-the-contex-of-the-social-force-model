\caption{\label{fig:11} (Color on-line only) Evacuation time and blocking 
time as a function of the desired velocity $v_d$. Both data sets represent the 
mean values from 60 evacuation processes. The simulated room was 20$\times$20~m 
with a single door of 1.2~m width on one side. The number of individuals inside 
the room was 225 (no re-entering mechanism was allowed). The simulation lasted 
until 160 individuals left the room.  }
