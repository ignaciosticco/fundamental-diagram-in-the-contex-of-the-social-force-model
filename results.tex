\subsection{\label{fundamental_diagram} Fundamental diagram in the original model}

In this Section we present the results relating the local flow, velocity and density (\textit{i.e.} the fundamental diagram). The measurements were taken in the middle of the corridor using the definitions given in Eq.~(\ref{ec-v}) and Eq.~(\ref{ec-flow}), and as shown in Fig.~\ref{corridor}. All the results shown here correspond to $R=1$~m (see Eq.~(\ref{ec-flow}) and Fig.~\ref{corridor}). We further barred $R$ until $R=3$, but no significant changes were observed. \\

Fig~\ref{fundamental_diagram_flow}, shows the fundamental diagram (flow vs. density) for different corridor widths. We can distinguish the two typical regimes of the fundamental diagram. In the free flow regime ($\rho < 5$), the flow increases linearly with the density, since collisions between pedestrians are scares. Pedestrians are able to achieve their desired velocity, leading to a flow that grows linearly with the density ($J \sim \rho$) until $\rho=5$. This behavior applies to all the analyzed corridor widths.\\

On the other hand, we have the congested branch  for $\rho > 5$. Here we face two different scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] For narrow corridors (say $w < 10$) we can see that the flow reduces as the density increases. This resembles the traditional behavior of the fundamental diagram reported in the literature. 
\item[(ii)] For wide corridors (say $w > 15$) we see that the flow increases with density. This contradicts the typical behavior of the fundamental diagram.   
\end{itemize}

In the case of narrow corridors, both the simulated case and the empirical results converge to a constant flow value. It is remarkable that the system does not reach a freezing state such as the one reported in Ref.\cite{kwak}. Recall that our simulations do not include any respect factor (see Ref.\cite{parisi2}), or changes in the net-time headway (Ref.\cite{helbing3}), or the urge to see an attraction (Ref.\cite{kwak}). We assume a well defined target and the same $v_d$ for all the pedestrians.\\

The inset in Fig.~\ref{fundamental_diagram_flow} corresponds to the empirical data from Helbing (\cite{helbing3}). at the entrance of the Jamaraat bridge (the corridor width was $w=22$~m). Notice that our simulated results corresponding to a $w=22$~m corridor, exhibit a different behavior along the congested regime. In the simulated case, the flow increases even for the greatest explored density. On the contrary, the empirical data exhibit a flow reduction for $\rho > 5$ until reaching a plateau for the highest explored density values.  \\

In order to fulfill the experimental fundamental diagram, it becomes necessary that the flow at the maximum explored density ($\rho_{max} = 9$) does not exceed the flow at $\rho = 5$ (upper bound). That is:  $J(\rho = 9) < J(\rho = 5)$. From the flow definition in Eq.~(\ref{ec-flow}) we can derive the bounding values

\begin{align*} 
v(\rho_{max}) &< \frac{5v_d}{\rho_{max}} \leq \frac{5}{9} v_d \\
\end{align*}

As our desired velocity is fixed at $v_d = 1$~m/s, we conclude that the speed at the maximum density has to be bounded by $v(\rho_{max}) \lesssim  0.5$~m/s in order to satisfy the qualitative behavior of the (experimental) fundamental diagram reported in the literature.\\

The above reasoning is consistent with the speed-density results shown in Fig.~\ref{fundamental_diagram_speed}. As a visual guide we plotted $v=0.5$~m/s with a horizontal dashed line. The close examination of $\rho_{max} = 9$ shows that values corresponding to the wide corridors ($w=15$~m and $w=22$~m) exceed $v=0.5$~m/s. But, those values corresponding to narrow corridors fall below $v=0.5$~m/s. \\

of the corridor once the system reached the stationary state (see Fig.~\ref{corridor}). The length of the corridor 
was $L=$28~m for all cases (with periodic boundary conditions in the \textit{x} direction).}
\end{figure}

The results shown in Fig.~\ref{fundamental_diagram_speed} confirm the fact that when the density is low enough, pedestrians manage to walk at the desired velocity ($v=v_d=1$~m/s). Above $\rho>5$, however the velocity begins to slow down. The inset shows the experimental data at the entrance of the Jamaraat bridge. We may conclude that our simulations agree with the experimental data for narrow corridors, but disagree as these become wider. The wider the corridor, the greater the velocity for all the density values. In Section \ref{velocity_profile} we will further discuss this topic.\\

It should be pointed out that the Jamaraat data does not a exhibit a ``really" constant velocity for low densities. But this seems reasonable since our simulations do not include the complexities of the real situation when the density is low. We will not analyze this phenomenon in this investigation. \\

was 28~m in all cases (with periodic boundary conditions in the \textit{x} direction).}
\end{figure}

We may summarize our first results as follows. We were able to validate the seminal SFM for narrow corridors through the fundamental diagram. However, the SFM (in its current version) disagrees with experimental data as the corridors widen. We will focus in the next Section on the velocity profile in order to investigate this discrepancy. 

\subsection{\label{velocity_profile} Velocity profile}

<<<<<<< HEAD
As we mentioned in Section \ref{fundamental_diagram}, when the density is low, pedestrians achieve the desired velocity ($v=v_d=1$~m/s). Since the results of the previous Section only hold for the area located in the middle of the corridor (see Fig.\ref{corridor}), we want to shed some light and understand what is happening across the entire corridor.\\

Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-w22} shows the velocity profile (velocity vs. \textit{y}-location) of the pedestrians across the corridor (see caption for details). We can see that low-density situations lead to a cruising velocity profile $v=v_d$. This is valid for every location in the corridor (not only the center as was previously noticed in Section \ref{fundamental_diagram}). For higher densities, the velocity profile turns into a parabola-like function. This shape resembles the usual velocity profile for laminar flow in a viscous fluid, where the velocity increases toward the center of a tube. In our case, pedestrians near the walls are the ones with the lower velocity. The velocity increases when departing from the wall until it reaches the maximum at the center of the corridor. This behavior suggests that the wall friction on the pedestrians, is playing a relevant role on the velocity distribution. We did some tests removing the walls, while setting periodic boundary conditions in the $y$-coordinate. This yield to constant-cruising velocity profiles for all the densities, confirming that the walls are a necessary condition for attaining a parabola-shaped speed profile.\\

This behavior suggests that the friction that the wall exerts on pedestrians, is playing a fundamental role in the velocity distribution. We did some simulations removing the walls and adding periodic boundary conditions in the $y$-coordinate. This yield to constant-cruising velocity profiles for all the densities, confirming that the walls are a necessary condition in order to produce a parabola-shaped speed profile.\\

Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-multi_width} shows the velocity profile for different widths. The horizontal axis of the plot corresponds to the $y$-location normalized by the width of the corridor. The density chosen was $\rho = 6$ since we wanted to study a situation in which pedestrians slow down. Recall that when $\rho<5$, collisions between pedestrians are not relevant (within the SFM). We can see that the lowest velocities occur in the regions near the walls. Additionally, there is a clear relation between $v_{max}$ and the corridor width. That is, the wider the corridor, the higher the maximum reached velocity.\\

Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-width-normaliz} exhibits the scaled velocity profile. The horizontal axis is normalized by the corresponding corridor width (just like in Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-multi_width}). Now, the vertical axis is normalized by the maximum velocity ($v_max$) corresponding to each data set. Filled markers correspond density $\rho=9$, while empty markers correspond to $\rho=6$. Notice that all the data follow the same  pattern, suggesting that the velocity profile exhibits a somewhat fundamental behavior, regardless the scale of the corridor (and the density). Hence, the velocity growth rate from the wall towards the center of the corridor, is the same in spite of the size of the corridor width.

\end{figure}

In summary, the scaled velocity profile (see Fig.\ref{_multi_width_normaliz}) does not report any relevant different as the corridor widens (withing the high density regime). This suggests that the pedestrian dynamics remain essentially the same. The maximum attainable velocity ($v_{max}$), however, seems to be a sensible parameter with respect to the flux.  The narrow corridors attain lower values of $v_max$ and thus lower flux. We may expect the flow not to increase if $v_{max}$ remains low enough along the explore density range.\\

%In this subsection we have shown that the velocity profile has a parabola shape. Pedestrians attain the maximum velocity in the middle of the corridor while the minimum is by the walls. We found out that once normalized by $v_{max}$ and the corridor width, the velocity profile yields a universal behavior (regardless the width of the corridor).\\

We may hypothesize that the friction force is somehow the key factor in the
flow reduction, as reported in the experimental fundamental diagram. This hypothesis further inspired us to analyze the role of the friction coefficient in a simple model for the corridor (see Appendix B). 

\subsection{Work done by friction force}

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the previous Section we studied the velocity profiles for different corridors as a function of density. Here we present the spacial distribution of the work done by the friction force. Only the pedestrian-pedestrian friction was computed.\\
=======
The work, was numerically calculated using the Trapezoidal rule on each pedestrian. The integration time step was $\Delta t = 0.05$~s. We divided the corridor into a grid with 1~m$\times$1~m cells in order to associate the work values with spacial location. In Fig.~\ref{abswg} we show three heat maps of the absolute value of the work done by the friction force. The horizontal and vertical axis represent the $x$-location and $y$-location of the corridor respectively. The heat map denotes higher work for red color and lower work for blue color. The walls are located at $y=0$ and $y=w$ (bottom and top of each figure). Fig.~\ref{abswg_width10} corresponds to a 10 m width corridor, Fig.~\ref{abswg_width15} corresponds to a 15 m width corridor and Fig.~\ref{abswg_width22} corresponds to a 22 m width corridor.\\
>>>>>>> 40f6f99f456a1f60a61ce0658e37800c9fd548b5

The work, was numerically obtained through the integration Trapezoidal rule on each pedestrian. The integration time step was $\Delta t = 0.05$~s. We binned the corridor into a squared grid of 1~m$\times$1~m cells in order to associate the work values with the corresponding spacial location. Fig.~\ref{abswg} shows three color maps of the absolute value of the work done by the friction force. The horizontal and vertical axis represent the $x$-location and $y$-location of the corridor respectively. The color map associates higher work values with red colors and lower work for blue colors. The walls are located at $y=0$ and $y=w$ (bottom and top of each figure). Fig.~\ref{abswg_width10} corresponds to a 10 m width corridor, Fig.~\ref{abswg_width15} corresponds to a 15 m width corridor and Fig.~\ref{abswg_width22} corresponds to a 22 m width corridor.\\

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the three figures we observe similar pattern: the regions near the walls (bottom and top) are the most dissipative ones. The center of the corridor is though not a very dissipative one. Furthermore, work seems to increase with the corridor width. This occurs because the relative velocity between pedestrians is greater in the wide corridors than in narrow ones. This can be checked by comparing the slopes between parabolas in Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-multi_width}. As can be seen there, the wider the corridor, the greater the slope (corresponding to locations near the wall).\\

Recall from Eq.(\ref{granular}), that the friction force depends on the compression and the relative velocity among pedestrians. The compression levels remain the same in the three cases since the compression only depends on the density (which is fix at $\rho=6$ for the three color maps). Thus, the differences between Figs.~\ref{abswg_width10}, \ref{abswg_width15} and \ref{abswg_width22} can only explained by the increment of the relative velocity between individuals. \\

The above observations drive the following conclusion. The maximum attainable velocity $v_max$ accomplishes a maximum velocity slope (with its associated friction dissipation). Either the friction with the walls and the friction between the pedestrians appear as relevant magnitudes for properly slowing down the crowd velocity, in order to fit the experimental data. \ref{appendix_2} supports this assertion with a simple example.  

\subsection{Friction modification}

As already mentioned, the results shown so far indicate that friction may be the key magnitude for fitting the fundamental diagram into the experimental data. We want to make clear that fitting the experimental data means mimicking (qualitatively) the congested regime reported by different authors (including the Jamaraat study in Ref.~\ref{helbing3}) for corridors as width as 22~m. The seminal version of the Social Force Model proposes the same friction coefficient for the pedestrian-pedestrian interaction and the pedestrian-wall interaction. The proposed value was $\kappa = 2.4\times10^{5}$. This value is widely used in many studies despite it lacks a rigorous foundation. \\

We tested the friction coefficient modification in Appendix \ref{appendix_2} and we found that the fundamental diagram experiences a qualitatively change when the friction coefficient $\kappa$ is varied. We further performed numerical simulations in the context of the SFM. We call $\kappa_i$ as the friction coefficient of the pedestrian-pedestrian interaction and $\kappa_w$ as the friction coefficient of the pedestrian-wall interaction. Fig.~\ref{fgmodified-w22} shows the flow vs density for different values of $\kappa_i$ and $\kappa_w$.\\

The triangular symbols in Fig.~\ref{fgmodified-w22} corresponds to the increase in one order of magnitude of the wall friction (now $\kappa_w = 2.4\times10^{6}$), leaving the pedestrian-pedestrian friction unchanged (\textit{i.e.}, $\kappa_i = 2.4\times10^{5}$). We can see that the flow reduces a little bit, but this is not enough to change significantly the congested regime. \\

The circles in Fig.~\ref{fgmodified-w22} correspond to a modification of the friction between pedestrians without changing the value of the wall friction. We increased the pedestrian-pedestrian friction by a factor of ten ($\kappa_i = 2.4\times10^{6}$). Here we see a significant reduction of the flow. The qualitative behavior resembles the fundamental diagram reported by Helbing \textit{et al}. with a well defined congested regime for the greatest densities.\\

We also tested the case were both friction coefficients surpass ten times the value of the original model (now $\kappa_w = \kappa_i = 2.4\times10^{6}$). The squared symbols represent this scenario. As expected, the flow reduces significantly respect the original case (cross symbol). Interestingly, the reduction of the flow is more than the reduction due to the increment of $\kappa_i$ plus the reduction of the flow due to $\kappa_w$. This behavior is indicative that the superposition principle does not hold in this system because of the non-linearity of the equation of motion.   \\

This finding allows us to affirm that the friction plays a crucial role in the functional behavior of the fundamental diagram. The increment of both individual-individual friction and wall friction are determinant in order to achieve a congested regime. More specifically, the empirical behavior for the fundamental diagram can be achieved by properly increasing the friction coefficients.\\

Recall that other authors address the ``congested regime problem" by modifying different aspects of the model. Ref.~\cite{parisi2} imposes zero desired velocity once pedestrians are close enough, Ref.~\cite{johansson} increases the relaxation time in order to slow down the net-time headway, and more recently,  Ref.~\cite{kwak} induce the jamming transition by an attraction. Many of these approaches seem to be equivalent. In Appendix \ref{appendix_1} we discuss about how the modification of the relaxation time and the increment of the friction coefficient yield a similar effect, since both affect the same term in the reduced-in-units equation of motion. \\

We claim that in real scenarios, a combination of all these factors may be the cause of the marked flow reduction that portray the fundamental diagram. The pedestrians path can be very complex even if it is a simple enclosure (straight corridor) and the target is well defined (unidirectional flow). Beyond the complexities given by the internal motivations of pedestrians, we strongly suggest studying and modeling coefficients of friction between individuals and the friction with the walls. These two parameters have shown to be very important in the pedestrian dynamics and deserve a closer inspection in future research.\\

We want to emphasize that the proposals stated in Refs.~\cite{parisi2,johansson,kwak}  only apply under normal conditions. If a crowd is under high levels of anxiety (\textit{i.e.} panic), pedestrians will neither keep distance between each other, nor will feel the urge to see an ``attraction". The only goal in an evacuation under panic is to leave the room. Thus, studying the friction coefficients may be a critical factor to properly reproduce the dynamics of a massive evacuation under stress.\\

With all these insights, we can say that the narrow corridors have no drawback in the fitting of the flow vs. density relation because very high velocities are not attainable. This happens because in narrow corridors, the friction of the walls has a lot of ``relative weight" in the overall friction of the system. 
The friction exerted by the walls is fundamental in order to produce the parabolic shape of the velocity profile. The walls provide friction force in the opposite direction to the speed of the individual (drag backwards), since they act like a fixed pedestrian. In other ways, friction between pedestrians can produce either drag forward or drag backwards depending on the the contacting pedestrians velocities (see Eq.~\ref{granular}).\\

For each density, we measure the flow once the system reaches the stationary state.}
\end{figure}

In this subsection we have shown that an adequate modification of the friction coefficients yields a fundamental diagram that follows qualitatively the behavior reported through empirical data (say flow reduction for the highest densities). We have also discussed different approaches proposed by other authors in order to overcome this problem. See Appendix \ref{appendix_1} for a more detailed discussion.\\

\subsection{\label{clusters}Clusters}

Cluster formation is a very important process in pedestrian dynamics. Moreover, is the key process that explains the clogging phenomena in bottleneck evacuations. We analyzed the clustering formation according to the granular cluster definition given in~\cite{Dorso1}
In Fig.~\ref{cluster_distribution} we show the histogram of the cluster size distribution for three different densities, from top to bottom: $\rho=4.5$, $\rho=5$ and $\rho=5.5$. we have chosen these three values as lower densities yield to non-clustered arrangements and higher densities yield a unique giant cluster.     
For each density we studied two situations. The cluster size distribution for the original parameters of the Social Force Model (left hand side plots) and the cluster size distribution corresponding to the increment of the friction coefficients by a factor of ten (right hand side plots).\\

We found a couple of intriguing results. Incrementing the density produces bigger size clusters until it reaches a critical value in which the size distribution shifts to a bimodal distribution (compare \ref{size_distribution_w22_density5} with \ref{size_distribution_w22_density5_5} and \ref{size_distribution_w22_density4.5_kx10} with \ref{size_distribution_w22_density5_kx10}).  Once this phenomena takes place, there are only two possibilities for the clusters: either they are small sized clusters caged in the crowd or is a giant cluster (with a size comparable with the entire crowd).\\

We also found that this phenomena is prompted by the friction. If the friction is higher, the transition to the bimodal distribution takes place for lower density values. See Fig.~\ref{size_distribution_w22_density5} and Fig.~\ref{size_distribution_w22_density5_kx10}. Despite the fact that both correspond to the same density,  \ref{size_distribution_w22_density5_kx10} already attained the bimodal distribution since the friction force is ten times greater than \ref{size_distribution_w22_density5}. This peculiar phenomenon occurs because when there is more friction, individuals find it more difficult to detach from each other. In the opposite case, when the friction is low, the individuals detach themselves more easily, leading to a situation where large clusters are less probable.\\

\label{cluster_distribution}
\end{figure}

To understand the full picture, in Fig.~\ref{fic} we show the fraction of clustered individual as a function of the density for four different situations in which we change the friction coefficients. The fraction of clustered individuals is defined as the amount of pedestrians that belong to a cluster over the total number pedestrians in the corridor. 
We can see that there is a transition from a non-clustered crowd to a full-clustered crowd. This transition occurs in a very limited range of densities, causing the process of cluster formation to occur for $4.4<\rho<5.3$. When the friction coefficient is high, the transition takes place for lower density values. This result is consistent with the histograms shown in Fig~.\ref{cluster_distribution}, supporting the fact that friction promotes the formation of clusters. \\

As expected, the transition becomes more abrupt when both $\kappa_i$ and $\kappa_w$ are incremented (squared symbol plot). When only one of those two coefficients is incremented, the fraction of clustered individuals is greater than the original model. Notice that there is not a big difference between the modification of $\kappa_i$ and the modification of $\kappa_w$. This suggests that it does not matter if the clusterization begins to take place in the areas near the walls or in the middle of the crowd.\\

The pedestrians walk across a corridor with $v_d=1$m/s. The measurements were recorded every 0.5~s once the system reaches the stationary state. The values corresponding to the fraction of clustered individuals were averaged over 170~s. The cluster cutoff distance was 0.46~m (equivalent to the shoulders width of the pedestrians).}

In this Section we have proved that the clustering process can be prompted by incrementing the friction coefficient. Both the size of the clusters and the fraction of clustered individuals increase with friction and density.\\
