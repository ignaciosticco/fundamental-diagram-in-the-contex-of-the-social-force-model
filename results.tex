\subsection{Fundamental diagram in the original model}

In Fig~\ref{fundamental_diagram_flow}, we show the fundamental diagram (density vs. flow) for different corridor widths. We can distinguish the two typical branches of the fundamental diagram. In the free flow branch ($\rho < 5$), the flow increases linearly with the density since there are no collisions between pedestrians. This behavior applies to all the corridor width analyzed. In the congested branch ($\rho > 5$), we have two different scenarios:


\begin{itemize}
\item i) In narrow corridors (say $w < 10$) we can see that the flow reduces as the density increases. This resembles the traditional behavior of the fundamental diagram reported in the literature. 
\item ii) In wide corridors (say $w > 15$) we see that the flow increases with density. This contradicts the typical behavior of the fundamental diagram.   
\end{itemize}

%Since this discrepancy only appears in the congested branch, we can guess that the the friction force may be playing a role in the flow reduction.  

In order to satisfy the fundamental diagram reported in the literature, It is necessary that the flow at the maximum density ($\rho_{max} = 9$) be less than the flow at $\rho = 5$. That is:  $J(\rho = 9) < J(\rho = 5)$. From the flow definition in Ec.~\ref{ec-flow} we can derive

\begin{align*} 
v(\rho_{max}) &< \frac{5v_d}{\rho_{max}} \\
v(\rho_{max}) &< \frac{5}{9} v_d
\end{align*}


As our desired velocity is fixed $v_d = 1$~m/s, we conclude that the speed at the maximum density has to be bounded by $v(\rho_{max}) \lesssim 	0.5$~m/s in order to satisfy the qualitative behavior of the fundamental diagram reported in the literature.

The above reasoning is consistent with the speed-density results shown in Fig.~\ref{fundamental_diagram_flow}. Notice that the speed values in $\rho_{max} = 9$ is higher than $v=0.5$~m/s for $w=15$~m and $w=22$~m. Whereas the speed value for $\rho_{max}$ is lower than $v=0.5$~m/s for narrow corridors ($w<15$)\\

\subsection{Speed profile}

In Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-w22} we show the speed profile (speed vs. y-location) of the pedestrians in the  corridor. When the density is low, pedestrians achieve the desired velocity ($v=v_d=1$~m/s), leading to a cruising velocity profile for every position in the corridor. For higher densities, the speed profile shifts to a parabola-like shape. Pedestrians near near the walls are the one with the lower speed. The speed increases when moving away from the wall until it reaches the maximum in the middle of the corridor. This behavior suggests that the friction that the wall exerts on pedestrians, is playing a fundamental role in the speed profile. We did some simulations removing the walls and adding periodic boundary conditions in the y-coordinate. This yield to constant-cruising speed profiles for all the densities, confirming that the walls are a necessary condition in order to produce a parabola-shaped speed profile.

\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-multi_width} we show the speed profile for different widths, the x-axis is the y-position normalized by the width of the corridor. The density chosen was $\rho = 6$ since we wanted to study a situation in which pedestrians collide with each other, remember that when $\rho<5$ pedestrians manage to avoid collisions. We can see the parabola shape in which lower velocities are placed in the areas near the walls. The inset of the figure shows the same data normalized by the maximum speed value correspondent to each corridor width. It is interesting that once normalized, all the data follow the same pattern. This suggests that regardless the scale of the corridor, the speed profile exhibit a fundamental behavior.

\subsection{Work done by friction force}


We have shown how the velocity takes different values along the corridor. We also analyzed the work done by the friction between pedestrians in the corridor. The work exerted was numerically calculated for each pedestrian with the Simpson rule. The integration step was $\Delta t = 0.05$~s. Once all the pedestrians had its work calculated, we proceed to create a squared grid in the corridor. The cells were 1~m length, and we associated the work on the pedestrians to the cell where they were placed.  In Fig.~\ref{abswg} we show three heat maps of the absolute value of the work done by the pedestrian-pedestrian friction force. The axis represent the x location and y location of the corridor. The heat map denotes higher work for red color and lower work for the blue color. The walls are located at $y=0$ and $y=w$ (bottom and top of each figure). Fig.~\ref{abswg_width10} corresponds to a 10 m width corridor, Fig.~\ref{abswg_width15} corresponds to a 15 m width corridor and  Fig.~\ref{abswg_width10} corresponds to a 22 m width corridor.

In the three figures we observe the same pattern: the regions near the walls (bottom and top) are the regions in which pedestrians suffer the higher work done by the friction. In the center of the corridor the work is reduced in all the cases. Another interesting observation is that the work seems to increase with the corridor width. This happens because in the wide corridors the relative velocity between pedestrians is greater. See Fig.~\ref{speed-profile-multi_width} and compare the slopes between the parabolas. It can be seen that the wider the corridor, the greater the slope (corresponding to locations near the wall). As it is stated in Eq.(\ref{granular}), the friction force depends on the compression and the relative velocity among pedestrians. The differences between Figs.~\ref{abswg_width10}, \ref{abswg_width15} and  \ref{abswg_width22}  are only explained by the increment of the relative velocity. The compression levels remain the same in the three cases since the compression only depends on the density (which is fix at $\rho=6$ for the three figures).

\subsection{Friction modification}

As already mentioned, the results shown so far indicate that friction may be the key to improving the fundamental diagram. We want to make clear that improving the fundamental diagram means obtaining the congested branch reported by different authors, in particular in the Jamaraat study of Helbing et al. where the congested branch reaches a plateau in a 22~m width corridor. The original version of the Social Force Model proposes the same friction coefficient for the pedestrian-pedestrian interaction and the pedestrian-wall interaction. The value proposed was $\kappa = 2.4\times10^{4}$. This value is widely used by the pedestrian dynamics community despite it lacks a rigorous foundation. 

We tested how the system reacts to the modification of the friction value. Fig.~\ref{fgmodified-w22} shows the flow vs density for different friction values. The triangles correspond to the increment of the wall friction in one order of magnitude (now $\kappa_w = 2.4\times10^{5}$). In this case we left the pedestrian-pedestrian friction unchanged. We can see that the flow reduces a little bit, but this is not enough to produce the negative slope that characterizes the congested regime. 

The circles correspond to a modification of the friction between pedestrians without changing the value of the wall friction. We increased the pedestrian-pedestrian friction by a factor of ten ($\kappa_i = 2.4\times10^{5}$). Here we see a significant reduction of the flow. The qualitative behavior resembles the fundamental diagram reported by Helbing et al. with a well defined congested branch for the greatest densities.

We also tested the case were both friction coefficients are ten times the value of the original model (now $\kappa_w = \kappa_i = 2.4\times10^{5}$). The squared symbols represent this scenario. As expected, the flow reduces significantly respect the original case (cross symbol plot). Interestingly, the reduction of the flow is more than the reduction due to the increment of $\kappa_i$ plus the reduction of the flow due to $\kappa_w$. This behavior is indicative that the superposition principle does not hold in this system. This phenomena is explained by the non-linearity of the equation of motion.   

This finding allows us to affirm that the friction plays a crucial role in the functional behavior of the fundamental diagram. The increment of both individual-individual friction and wall friction are determinant in order to achieve a congested branch. Other authors attain the congested branch modifying different aspects of the model. Parisi et al. impose zero desired velocity once pedestrians are close enough~\ref{parisi1}, Johannson increases the relaxation time in order to slow down the net-time headway~\ref{johannson} and more recently, Kwak et al.\ref{kwak} induce the jamming transition by an attraction. Our results show that the empirical behavior for the fundamental diagram can be achieved by properly increasing the friction coefficients. In appendix we discuss about how the modification of the relaxation time and the increment of the friction coefficient yield the same effect, since they affect the same term in the reduced-in-units equation of motion.  

We argue that in real scenarios, a combination of all these factors may be the cause of the marked flow reduction that portray the fundamental diagram. The pedestrian's path can be very complex even if it is a simple enclosure (straight corridor) and the target is well defined (unidirectional flow). Beyond the complexities given by the internal motivations of pedestrians, we strongly suggest studying and modeling coefficients of friction between individuals and friction with the walls. These two parameters have shown to be very important in the dynamics and deserve a closer inspection in future research.

For each density we measure the flow once the system reaches the stationary state.}
